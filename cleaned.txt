dot were formulated from directions given by health care practitioners to patients with diabetes during a routine clinic visit  in addition question development was guided by reviewing validated math and literacy tests  arriving at the answers will require not only the ability to perform a variety of math skills such as addition subtraction and multiplication but also the application of those skills in the daily setting funding the development and validation of this scale was funded with support from the  american  diabetes  association  novo  norsk  clinical  research  award the  prize

regularly i am less likely to have health problems  it seems that my health is greatly influenced by accidental happenings  i can only maintain my health by consulting health professionals i am directly responsible for my health  other people play a big part in whether  i stay healthy or become sick  whatever goes wrong with my health is my own fault  when  i am sick i just have to let nature run its course  health professionals keep me healthy  when  i stay healthy i am just plain lucky  my physical wellbeing depends on how well  i take care of myself  when  i feel ill i know it is because i have not been taking care of myself properly  the type of care  i receive from other people is what is responsible for how well i recover from an illness  even when  i take care of myself it is easy to get sick  when  i become ill it is a matter of fate i can pretty much stay healthy by taking good care of myself  following doctor is orders to the letter is the best way for me to stay
