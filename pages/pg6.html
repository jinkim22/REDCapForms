Researchers will be able to import this metadata directly into their REDCap projects for immediate use in clinical trial data collection.
	
	Developed in participation with global stakeholders via CDISC’s <a href="https://www.cdisc.org/system/files/about/cop/CDISC-COP-001-Standards_Development_2019.pdf">Standards Development Process</a>, CDASH establishes a standard way to collect data across studies. Together, the CDASH Model, CDASH Implementation Guide (CDASHIG), and CDASHIG metadata tables define basic standards for the collection of clinical trial data and how to implement the standard for specific CRFs. Originally developed for use in regulatory submissions, the CDASH standard can be used by any organization or individual involved in the collection, preparation, and analysis of clinical research data to facilitate publication, warehousing, and meta-analyses. CDASH directly supports the generation of eCRFs making this step easier for researchers.  These eCRFs and structures foster data aggregation and sharing while delivering more transparency to those who conduct data review.
